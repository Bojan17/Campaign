This is an app made to resemble kickstarter.com , using Ethereum network and smart contracts.
Solidity is used for writing smart contracts, React.js for front-end and Next.js
for routing and server side rendering. For styling I used semantic-react.

If you want to test app clone this repo, and run npm install then npm run dev
You must have metamask installed in your Chrome browser and run Rinkeby test network.
